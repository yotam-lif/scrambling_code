r"""Figure 4: ancestral DFEs and the autocorrelation of the walks that leave them.

Six panels on a 2 x 3 grid.  Every COLUMN is one ancestor: its whole measured DFE on top,
and below it the DFE autocorrelation along an adaptive walk started from that same ancestor.

    A  REL606 (LB)   -- Limdi ancestor, 3488 genes above the cut.
    B  REL607 (LB)   -- Limdi ancestor, 3497 genes above the cut.
    C  REL607 (DM25) -- Couce 0K ancestor, 13258 segments above the cut.

    D  ARA-1  (LB)   -- Limdi REL606 -> Ara-1 at 50K, assayed in LB.
    E  ARA+2  (LB)   -- Limdi REL607 -> Ara+2 at 50K, assayed in LB.
    F  ARA+2  (DM25) -- Couce Ara+2, 0K -> 15K, assayed in DM25.

The column pairing is not decorative.  The walk in each bottom panel is simulated in the
heavy-tailed FGM whose parameters were fitted to the DFE drawn directly above it, so a
column reads as one claim: this is the landscape the fit sees, and this is what a walk on
that landscape does to the correlation between an early and a late measurement of the same
mutation.  The stored walks were generated from an earlier run of the same maximum
likelihood search and differ from the fits printed in row 1 in the third significant figure
(REL606 r = 0.382 against 0.379, REL607 0.480 against 0.485, Couce 0K 0.541 against 0.534,
with sigma and mu likewise); each cache carries the exact numbers it used in its own
metadata block.  That drift is the reproducibility of a multistart optimum, not a change of
model.


ROW 1 -- the fitted DFEs
------------------------
The three panels share a y axis, so only the leftmost carries tick labels and only the
leftmost carries the legend; the fitted values are repeated in every panel.

Each panel spans the deleterious tail, the bulk and the beneficial tail at once.  A
single bin width cannot do that -- the bulk needs bins the deep tail would leave empty --
so the histogram is adaptive: fine bins are merged left to right until each carries at
least MIN_COUNT observations.  Horizontal bars are the bin extents, so a wide point in
the tail reads as the wide bin it is.

Two models, both fitted by full unbinned maximum likelihood directly to the measured
effects.  Neither is convolved with the published measurement errors, so each curve is a
prediction for the pooled histogram it is drawn against.

    canonical    Fisher's Geometric Model with isotropic Gaussian mutation vectors:
                 delta ~ N(0, sigma^2 I_n), s = -x.delta - ||delta||^2 / 2.
    heavy-tailed The same geometry with a beta-prime radial mixture on the mutation
                 length -- delta = sqrt(q) omega with q = sigma^2 T and
                 T ~ BetaPrime(n/2, mu).  mu = 1/2 recovers a radial Cauchy; the
                 canonical model is the mu -> infinity limit at fixed sigma^2.

Both likelihoods are conditional on the observed effect clearing LOWER_CUT = -0.5, which
is where both assays stop resolving deleterious effects.

Both fits use every retained effect -- no tail trimming -- so the two logliks are
maximised on the same sample and are directly comparable.

Fits are cached in data/fig3_fgm_fits.json; pass --refit to recompute them.  The file keeps
its name because TableS4_fgm_params.py and code_tmp/poster_fig5_couce_noise.py both read it
by that path, and it holds one entry (couce_2K) that no panel here draws.


ROW 2 -- the simulated and measured autocorrelations
----------------------------------------------------
Each panel shows SSWM adaptive walks in the heavy-tailed FGM fitted to that column's
ancestor *without* measurement-error convolution.  Two probe subsets are drawn per panel:
all probes (r100) and the probes surviving a cut of the largest-|s| ancestral effects,
defined once from the noisy ancestral measurement and then held fixed.

The cut follows cmn_scatter, so each panel matches its own scatter panels in fig1 and figs
S1-S4: 10% for the Limdi data, whose effects run out to |s| = 0.65, and 2% for the Couce
data, whose effects are compact enough that a 10% cut would reach inside the bulk.  Hence
r90 in panels D and E and r98 in panel F.  All three rank on |s| and drop the
LARGEST-magnitude fraction, not the signed effect; the drawn column of each cache is checked
against the ``tail_exclusions`` and ``exclusion_mode`` recorded in that cache's own metadata,
so a dot and the curve it sits on cannot come to mean different things.  Every cache carries
a third cut that is loaded and not shown.

Curves are smoothed for display with a Gaussian filter (sigma = 1.6 steps), with BOTH
endpoints pinned to their raw values -- t = 0 because r = 1 there by construction, and the
last step because that is where the measured dots sit and where the plateau is read off.
This is cosmetic and rounds the corners of the steep stretch around t = 10-16.  It is
defensible because the step-to-step wiggle it removes is Monte-Carlo noise and nothing else:
splitting the 500 walks into two disjoint halves gives medians that disagree by 0.01-0.02 at
exactly the steps where the kinks appear, and the rms second difference of the raw curves
(0.005 for r100, 0.015 for r90) is BELOW what sampling noise in the median alone would
produce (0.011 and 0.022).  The honest fix is more walks -- the noise falls as 1/sqrt(N) --
which means regenerating the caches, not editing this script.

Solid curves are the latent correlation -- the model's own effects, with no measurement
error anywhere.  Dashed curves add rank-matched measurement noise: each simulated mutation
is assigned the published error of the empirical gene at its own effect rank, drawn fresh at
every step for the endpoint and once per replicate for the ancestor.  The band is the
16-84% interval over walk x noise replicates.  Filled stars are the measured
correlations.

Where the markers sit
---------------------
Panels D and E carry a t = 0 marker, F does not.  The t = 0 marker is the ISOGENIC CONTROL:
the same genotype assayed twice, so nothing has fixed between the two measurements and the
only thing separating them is the assay itself.  It is the ceiling the panel's curves start
from -- the simulation asserts r = 1 at t = 0, and the control says what the measurement can
actually deliver there.  Both are read straight out of TableS1 (``REL606 green -> red`` and
``REL607 green -> red``) rather than recomputed, on the same |s|-ranked ladder as every other
marker, so the figure and that table cannot drift apart.

Panel F has no such row to draw.  The Couce release publishes no replicate of a timepoint;
its only same-background pair is ``fitted1`` against ``fitted2``, two fits of the SAME five
read counts.  Their disagreement is 0.29x the published per-segment error where a genuine
replicate scores about 1 (Limdi's green/red channels give 1.5-1.8), so their r = 0.98 is an
upper bound on a ceiling, not a control -- see the FIT-VARIANT ROWS block in
``code_figs/TableS2_couce_autocorr.py``.  Drawn at t = 0 it would sit pinned at the top of
the frame and read as an assay far more reproducible than Limdi's, when it is really the only
column whose t = 0 would not be a replicate.  Better absent than misleading.

Panel F carries two sets of dots.  The right-hand set sits at 22 fixed mutations, the count
the 0K -> 15K walk cache was built around; the left-hand set at 9 is the short 0K -> 2K leg.
(The main text quotes roughly 8 fixed mutations for the 0-2K interval and 22 for 2K-15K, so
the right-hand dots are the later interval rather than the cumulative total; keep the two
consistent when the caption is written.)  The t = 9 correlations are stated in ``PANELS``
rather than recomputed here -- see the comment on that marker.

Panels D and E instead put their dots at the right-hand edge, labelled with the substitution
count they really correspond to, so that their position is not read as a claim about how many
mutations fixed.  Ara-1 is a point-mutator carrying of order 1100 mutations by 50K, almost
all of them hitchhikers that SSWM would never fix; Ara+2 is a non-mutator and carries about
70.  Neither number is a step count.  Fifteen steps is inside the range over which both
simulated walks reach their plateau, so those dots are plateau references placed where the
curves have levelled off.

The panels stop at different times.  The Couce cache holds a walk at its peak once it runs
out of beneficial mutations, so all 500 walks contribute at every step.  The Limdi caches
write NaN instead, and those walks peak after a median of about 19 steps, so beyond about 15
the median is taken over a shrinking and increasingly atypical set of survivors and starts to
rattle.  Panels D and E therefore stop at 15, where 446 and 496 of the 500 walks are still
going -- and stopping both at the same step is also what makes them readable side by side.

One asymmetry is inherited from the two simulation pipelines and is not a choice made here:
Couce's probe library is ascertained on the observed 0K effect window, Limdi's on the latent
ancestral effect clearing the -0.5 assay cut.

Reads cached walks from data/FGM_HEAVY_TAILED; it does not re-run them.
