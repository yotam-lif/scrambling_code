r"""Table S1: DFE autocorrelation across the Limdi LTEE TnSeq panel.

For every transition ``early -> late`` we ask how well a mutation's fitness effect measured
in the EARLIER background predicts its effect in the LATER one, over the mutations assayed in
both.  That is the DFE autocorrelation -- the Pearson ``r`` of the matched pairs -- and it is
the observable the p-spin / FGM scrambling picture predicts decays with the number of fixed
mutations separating the two genotypes.  Effects are LOG-fitness selection coefficients, so no
conversion is needed.

Rows, all from the Limdi LTEE TnSeq panel (data/data_limdi).  Per-GENE effects, averaged over
the TA sites in the gene and (except in the replicate rows) over both technical replicates.
Genes are matched on the metadata row index of the .npy fitness matrices.

  12 EVOLVED transitions -- each 50K clone against its own founder: REL606 -> Ara-N and
      REL607 -> Ara+N, twelve independent 0 -> 50K comparisons.

  TECHNICAL CONTROLS, ONE PER LIBRARY -- 14 rows, "<pop> green -> red".  The two barcode channels of a
      single library, unaveraged: same strain, same mutagenesis, same assay, correlated against
      each other.  Nothing separates the two numbers but measurement noise, so each is the
      reproducibility of that one measurement and the hardest ceiling there is.  Both ancestors
      have one (these are the rows the poster figure shows as its control panel,
      ``code_tmp/poster_fig1.py`` panel C) and so does every 50K clone, printed directly above
      its own transition.

      The per-clone rows are there because the twelve 50K measurements are NOT equally good, and
      a single shared ceiling hides that.  Their r_90 runs 0.650 to 0.893.  The printed block
      ``evolved r_90 against its OWN 50K technical control`` puts each transition next to the
      reproducibility of the very measurement it depends on: an evolved row can only be read as
      scrambling where its own control is high.  Two rows are worth reading that way.  Ara-2
      reproduces BETTER than almost anything in the panel (control r_90 = 0.848) yet its
      transition is -0.081, which is the cleanest possible demonstration that its problem is
      systematic bias and not noise -- exactly what Limdi et al. excluded it for.  Ara+6, a
      mutator with 2600 fixed mutations, has a fine control (0.833) and the lowest genuine
      transition (0.132), so there the collapse IS the landscape.

  All 14 control rows carry ``n_fixed_mut = 0`` because a green -> red pair is one library
  against itself, so on the scrambling axis they are the origin.  REL606 -> REL607 is deliberately
  not included as a control because the araA marker may itself affect fitness.

    A NOTE ON MATCHING (this is what the previous version of this table got wrong).  The
    Limdi pairs used to be matched on the ``Genes`` column of ``dfe_data_pandas.csv``.  That
    column is mislabelled upstream by a pandas index-alignment slip -- see the block comment
    in ``cmn/cmn_exper.py`` -- so matching on it pairs genes by row *position*, which are the
    same real gene for only ~0.3-6.5% of rows.  It reported r ~ 0.008-0.18 for the Limdi
    transitions, i.e. essentially uncorrelated noise, which also contradicted the source
    paper's central finding that the landscape is largely conserved.  Matching on the row
    index of the .npy matrices is exact and gives r ~ 0.85-0.9.

THE LARGE-EFFECT TAIL DOMINATES r, which is why the table reports more than one subset.  The 3.7%
of genes with |s| > 0.3 carry 71% of the total DFE variance, and a knockout lethal in the ancestor
is still lethal at 50K, so the full-range r is largely a statement about essential genes rather
than about the landscape.  Earlier versions of this table dealt with that by cutting both sides at
Couce's ``s > -0.3`` essentiality threshold and reporting the disattenuated result as the primary
number.  That column is gone: cutting the LATE side conditions on the outcome being predicted (see
ANCESTOR-DEFINED NESTED SUBSETS below), which is the wrong thing to do to a scrambling
measurement.  The replacement is to rank by the ANCESTOR and remove a fixed fraction, which is
what every column here now does.

An earlier version also carried the Couce et al. Ara+2 lineage (0K -> 2K -> 15K, per-segment
insertion effects) in the same table.  Those rows are gone too.  They were never on the same
scale: knockouts lethal in DM25 are absent from the Couce library altogether rather than filtered
out of the analysis (see the block comment in ``cmn/cmn_exper.py``), so a percentile of the Couce
ancestor lands at s ~ -0.03 where a Limdi percentile lands at s ~ -0.25, and the two could not be
read against each other row by row.  The Couce comparison belongs in its own table.

EXCLUDED POPULATIONS (``excluded``).  Limdi et al. themselves drop Ara-2 and Ara+4 -- "we
excluded two populations derived from evolved clones from further analyses because their
fitness measurements were unreliable for technical reasons, and therefore not comparable to
the ancestor" -- on grounds stated before any cross-background comparison, so this is their
criterion and not a post-hoc convenience.  Both rows are KEPT here and merely flagged, so the
reader can see what is being set aside.  Both claims were verified directly against the two
technical replicates; see ``LIMDI_EXCLUDED`` for the numbers.  Ara-2 is the instructive one: its
error bars are among the smallest in the panel, yet it collapses to r_95 = 0.008 and r_90 =
-0.081, far below every other row.  Its problem is a systematic bias, not noise, so
no error-based correction could have rescued it -- which is why the flag is the right handling.

FIXED BACKGROUND MUTATIONS (``n_fixed_mut``).  Mutations fixed DURING that transition: the full
0 -> 50K complement for an evolved row, and 0 for every technical control.  This is the distance the
p-spin / FGM picture predicts r decays with.  The counts split cleanly into the six LTEE mutator
lines (Ara-1/-2/-3/-4, Ara+3, Ara+6: 800-2600) and the six non-mutators (70-125), which is the
standard picture and an internal check on the column.  Note the panel spans barely more than one
decade once the mutators are set aside, so the decay fits printed at the end are weak by
construction -- they are a consistency check, not the paper's evidence for decay.

MEASUREMENT NOISE.  Noise attenuates r: with per-observation error variance ``eps^2`` on each
side, ``r_obs = r_true * sqrt((V_e - eps_e^2)/V_e * (V_l - eps_l^2)/V_l)``.  Every number in this
table's ``r_100/r_95/r_90`` columns is the raw ``r_obs``; NOTHING is disattenuated, and that is
deliberate.  The adjacent ``r_*_null`` columns instead give a forward null expectation under
``Y_A = X + e_A`` and ``Y_E = X + e_E``: one numerically identical true effect ``X`` per gene,
independent mean-zero Gaussian errors, and the published per-gene standard errors on both sides.
For each gene, ``X`` is fitted as the inverse-variance weighted mean of the two observed effects.
The null columns are the median of 1,000 simulations that add fresh errors to BOTH endpoints and
then rebuild the ancestor-ranked 100/95/90 subsets inside each simulation.  This is an expected raw
correlation under no scrambling, not an estimate of a corrected correlation.  The correction
needs the reliability of each side, and stripping the deleterious tail strips most of the signal
variance with it: the ancestor reliability falls from ~0.98 at r_100 to ~0.49-0.67 at r_90, which
is exactly where the classical formula stops being trustworthy.  The 14 green/red controls answer
the within-library question empirically: they land at r_90 = 0.650 to 0.893, with the two ancestors
at 0.650 and 0.707.  The per-clone green/red row is the diagnostic that says whether a given evolved
row is worth interpreting at all.

THE WEIGHTED COLUMN, ``r_100_w``.  The one place the published per-gene errors are used.  Exactly
the pairs of ``r_100`` -- no gene filtered, by effect size or by error -- but each weighted by
w = 1/(sigma_early^2 + sigma_late^2) from ``errors_genes_inv.npy``.  This is NOT disattenuation
(see above, which still stands): it does not try to divide the noise out, it changes which genes
dominate the sum, demoting the badly measured ones instead of trusting them equally.  The same
column is in TableS2, where it reconciles this repo's r_100 with the rho = 0.99 the Ascensao paper
reports for a replicate pair in its Fig. 1E.

What it does here is the same in direction and sharper in the two places that matter.  The
green/red controls barely move (0.939-0.981 raw against 0.953-0.982 weighted) because for those
rows noise is the ONLY thing in play and it is already small, while every evolved row falls
(Ara-1 0.869 -> 0.780, Ara+6 0.820 -> 0.659), because weighting demotes the badly-measured
deleterious genes whose leverage was holding r_100 up.  The two flagged libraries are where it
speaks loudest.  Ara-2's technical control goes 0.879 -> 0.982, the best in the panel, while its
transition goes 0.532 -> 0.179: with the noisy genes demoted, that library reproduces essentially
perfectly and still fails to predict itself across 50K generations, which is systematic bias
stated about as plainly as the data can state it.  Ara+4, excluded for poor technical replicates,
likewise recovers to 0.958.

Read ``r_100_w`` against the controls in this table only.  The weights differ row to row, so it is
even less comparable across rows than r_100; the unweighted ladder remains the table's primary
result.

SIMULATED COLUMNS (``r_*_sim_latent`` and ``r_*_sim_noisy``), evolved rows only.  What the
adaptive-walk model predicts for the same three subsets, from the walk caches written by
``code_figs/sim_walk_caches.py`` under the SAME |s| subset rule as the measured columns
beside them.  Each transition has its own cache: 500 SSWM walks in a heavy-tailed (radial
beta-prime) FGM fitted to that row's own founder -- REL606 or REL607, from
``data/fig3_fgm_fits.json`` -- with a probe library of the same size as the matched gene set.

  r_*_sim_latent  the model's own effects, no measurement error anywhere
  r_*_sim_noisy   the same walks re-measured with rank-matched published per-gene errors:
                  each simulated mutation is assigned the error of the empirical gene at its own
                  effect rank, drawn once per replicate for the ancestor and fresh at every step
                  for the endpoint.  This is what the measured columns should be compared with.

WHERE ALONG THE WALK THEY ARE READ (``sim_t``).  At the PEAK -- each walk at its own last step,
where no beneficial mutation is left.  This is not a choice between equals.  Every Limdi row is a
0 -> 50K comparison carrying 70 to 2,600 fixed mutations, while an SSWM walk in these fitted
landscapes exhausts its beneficial mutations after a median of about 19, so there is no step at
which the model and the experiment carry the same number of substitutions and a fixed-``t`` read
would be an arbitrary point on the way there.  The plateau is what the model has to say about a
background that has finished adapting, which is the regime all twelve rows are in.  It is also the
only summary that uses all 500 walks: this driver writes NaN past a walk's terminal step, so a
fixed-time median past ~19 runs over a shrinking and increasingly atypical set of survivors.
``sim_walk_len`` reports the median walk length so the reader can see how far that plateau is.

    THE SIX ROWS SHARING A FOUNDER SHARE ALMOST THE WHOLE SIMULATION, and the columns show it:
    every REL606 row lands within 0.002 of the others at ``r_100_sim_latent`` and every REL607
    row within 0.001.  That is not a coincidence to be read as agreement -- those six walks are
    the same landscape, the same fitted parameters and the same seed stream, differing only in
    the probe-library size (the matched gene count, which varies by a few percent) and, for the
    noisy column, in which clone's published errors are assigned.  The model has no per-population
    input beyond that; it does not know that Ara-1 is a mutator and Ara+2 is not.  So the simulated
    columns are one prediction per founder against six measurements, not twelve independent
    predictions, and the spread across the measured rows is the thing being explained rather than
    something the simulation reproduces.  The noisy column does move a little between clones,
    because the error profiles genuinely differ -- Ara+4, the clone Limdi et al. flag for poor
    replicates, has the largest errors and the lowest simulated value of its group.

Control rows carry no simulated columns.  A green -> red pair is one library against itself with
nothing evolving between the two channels, so there is no walk to run.

ANCESTOR-DEFINED NESTED SUBSETS (the ``r_100 / r_95 / r_90`` columns).  The autocorrelation r
measures how much of the DFE is *preserved*; scrambling is its complement, roughly 1 - r.
Because r is a Pearson correlation it is dominated by the points farthest from the origin, so
where the subset is cut changes r a great deal, and reporting one cut hides that.  Each row
therefore carries r on three nested subsets, obtained by removing exactly 0%, 5% and 10% of the
LARGEST-MAGNITUDE ancestor effects:

  r_100   every matched pair, nothing removed (the large-effect tail included)
  r_95    the largest 5% of |ANCESTOR effect| removed  (``cut_95`` = the |s| threshold)
  r_90    the largest 10% removed                      (``cut_90`` likewise)

    RANKED ON |s|, NOT ON s.  Earlier versions of this table ranked on the signed effect and
    dropped the most deleterious fraction, so the retained subset was one-sided: it kept the whole
    beneficial tail while trimming only the deleterious one, and the two rungs therefore differed
    in what kind of mutation they contained as well as in how many.  Ranking on |s| removes the
    largest effects of EITHER sign, which leaves a subset symmetric about zero and makes "r_90" a
    statement about the near-neutral bulk rather than about the beneficial tail plus most of the
    bulk.  It is also the rule ``cmn/cmn_scatter.py`` applies in fig1 and figs S1-S4 and the rule
    the walk caches behind the simulated columns are generated under, so a measured number, its
    scatter panel and its simulated counterpart now all mean the same thing.  Both effects are
    large in this panel: the ten retained evolved rows move by roughly -0.03 to -0.08 at r_90.

This is the exclusion rule of the poster figure (``code_tmp/poster_fig1.py``, panels C-D), here
applied to every transition.  Two properties are why it replaced the fixed two-sided cutoffs the
table used to report:

  * The exclusion is defined ONLY from the early/ancestor measurement, never from the late one
    whose correlation is being computed.  A cutoff applied to both sides conditions on the
    outcome: at -0.1 it additionally discards the genes that are near-neutral in the ancestor but
    deleterious at 50K -- for REL607 -> Ara+2 that is 48 genes, 1.6% of the points, carrying 57%
    of the covariance, and dropping them takes r from 0.296 down to 0.223.  Those genes ARE the
    change being measured, so conditioning them away is exactly wrong here.  This is the same
    trap as in the tail table below, mirrored: there two-sided conditioning hides essential
    knockouts that became dispensable, here it hides neutral ones that became costly.  Note this
    survives the move to |s|: what is forbidden is using the LATE effect, not using both signs of
    the early one.
  * Removing a fixed FRACTION by rank keeps the subsets nested (90% inside 95% inside 100%) and
    the sample sizes equal across rows, so r_90 of one population is comparable to r_90 of
    another and of the control, which fixed absolute cutoffs do not guarantee.

Reading down the ladder: the high full-range r is carried by the preserved large-effect tail, and
stripping it exposes the scrambling in the near-neutral bulk.  Removing a tenth of the genes takes
the ten RETAINED evolved Limdi rows from r_100 ~ 0.82-0.91 down into the low hundredths, and the
two flagged populations start lower and fall further still -- which is the measurement problem the
source paper excluded them for, not extra scrambling.  Compare r only within the same retained
fraction; r is not comparable across ranges.

    A percentile is not a fixed value of |s|, so ``cut_95`` and ``cut_90`` are reported for every
    row: each is the |s| ABOVE WHICH genes were dropped.  Across the twelve EVOLVED rows they
    barely move, which is unsurprising, since all twelve rank on one of only two founders.  So
    those subsets are near-identical in absolute terms as well as in size, and r_90 really is
    row-to-row comparable among them.

    The green/red CONTROL rows are the exception and must not be read that way.  Each ranks on its
    own library's green channel, and a single unaveraged channel has both more noise and a
    library-specific tail, so their cuts spread much more widely.  Compare a control with its own
    evolved row, which is what the per-strain pairing is for, and do not compare two controls' raw
    r to each other.  The same caution applies to any library with a different lethal fraction;
    see the note on the removed Couce rows above.

TAIL DECORRELATION.  The complementary question -- does the conserved tail *also* scramble? --
has its own table, code_tmp/Table_tail_autocorr.py, because it must be conditioned differently:
on the ANCESTOR tail only (genes with ancestral s < -0.3), with the evolved effect left free.
Conditioning on both sides would discard the initially-essential knockouts that became
dispensable after evolution, which are precisely the tail's strongest decorrelation.  Done that
way, ~4.5% of essential knockouts revert to near-neutral.  So the tail is *mostly* conserved but not perfectly -- even large knockout costs shift
over 50K generations -- while the near-neutral bulk is where the bulk of the scrambling lives.
