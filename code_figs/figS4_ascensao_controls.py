r"""Figure S4: within-experiment Ascensao controls -- fig1 D in a second dataset.

Fig1 D is an isogenic control built from the Limdi assay's two reference channels.  The
Ascensao release supports the same control by a different route: each strain in each
experiment was fit twice, once per biological replicate, and replicate 1 against replicate 2
is one genotype, one library and one condition with nothing between the two numbers but assay
noise.  No evolution, so whatever decorrelation these panels show is measurement error, and it
is what calibrates the ancestor-to-evolved panels of fig S3.

    A  R (GHI)     B  R (MNO)
    C  L (GHI)     D  S (MNO)

``R`` is REL606, the Ara-2 ancestor; ``S`` and ``L`` are the two ecotypes that diversified from
it.  All three genotypes appear, and two of them twice over, in two experiments each -- so a high
correlation cannot be an artefact of one strain or one condition.  The experiment code in each
title is the whole condition label: the five monoculture regimes -- all serial dilution, differing
in dilution factor and transfer interval, GHI on acetate and MNO on DM27.8 at 1:10 -- are
documented in ``cmn/cmn_exper.py`` under ``ASENCAO_MONO``, and repeating the medium in the title
would only crowd it.

Panels are drawn by the same code as fig1 row 2 (``cmn/cmn_scatter.py``).  The partition drops the largest 2% of
|ancestral effect| rather than fig1 D's 10%: the Ascensao DFEs are an order of magnitude more
compact than Limdi's -- their 5th percentile already sits inside the bulk -- so anything deeper
would reach past the large-effect points.  The exclusion is defined only from the replicate-1 measurement and never from
replicate 2.

Rows are keyed on ``gene_ID``, never on row position -- gene sets differ substantially between
strains -- so the two indices are intersected per panel.  Nothing is clipped: each panel's
limits are the envelope of its own data, which is why the four differ.
