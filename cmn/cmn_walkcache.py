r"""Read simulated autocorrelation ladders out of a cached adaptive-walk run.

The walk drivers in ``code_tmp`` write one ``.npz`` per transition holding the Pearson
autocorrelation of every walk against its own ancestor, on each retained subset, at every
step.  Three consumers need the same few numbers out of those files -- Figure 4 and the
two autocorrelation tables -- so the reading lives here rather than being reimplemented
per caller with its own axis conventions.

    latent_correlations    the model's own effects, no measurement error anywhere
    observed_correlations  the same walk re-measured with rank-matched published errors
    walk_lengths           the step at which each walk ran out of beneficial mutations

TWO CACHE LAYOUTS, AND WHY IT MATTERS.  The Couce driver writes ``(walks, steps, cuts)``;
the Limdi driver carries a leading model axis, ``(models, walks, steps, cuts)``, with a
single model in it.  ``read`` drops that axis so both give the same shape.  Confusing the
two is not a loud failure -- indexing ``[:, 0]`` on the 4-D array silently selects walk 0
rather than model 0 and returns one walk's trace as if it were the median of five hundred
-- so the axis count is checked rather than assumed.

TWO TERMINATION CONVENTIONS, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE.  A walk stops when no beneficial
mutation is left.  The Couce driver then holds the genotype at its peak and keeps
recording, so every walk contributes at every step and a fixed-``time`` read is over all
of them.  The Limdi driver writes NaN instead, so past the median walk length a fixed-time
median is taken over a shrinking and increasingly atypical set of survivors.  That is why
``ladder`` offers ``time=None``: it reads each walk at its OWN last step, which is the
plateau every walk actually reached and the only summary that uses all of them.  Use a
fixed time when the transition has a known substitution count small enough to be inside
the walk, and the plateau when it does not -- an LTEE clone at 50K carries of order a
thousand mutations, and no SSWM walk reaches that.
