r"""Shared loaders for the experimental DFE datasets (Couce, Ascensao, Limdi).

One place to read and clean the raw experimental data, so every analysis script uses the
same conventions instead of copy-pasting the file parsing:

    code_figs/TableS1_limdi_autocorr.py         DFE autocorrelation across consecutive transitions
    cmn/cmn_fgm_exper.py                  FGM sigma-profile fit (adds tail-trimming on top)

The loaders return the data in the minimal cleaned form each analysis builds on; analysis-
specific steps (per-site matching, tail trimming, gene aggregation) are applied by the
caller. Dataset *structure* constants (which backgrounds are ancestor vs evolved, the
consecutive intervals, the Limdi LTEE panel) also live here since they describe the data.

# Couce et al. -- per-SEGMENT selection coefficients (fitted1) per timepoint
#
# THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS IS NOT AN INSERTION SITE.  Couce et al. "divided each locus into 5
# segments of equal length and then pooled all insertions in each segment", so one row is a
# fifth of a gene (or of an intergenic region), pooled over ``abn`` insertion mutants (median
# 7).  ``alle`` = "<ORF>-<segment 1..5>" is therefore the identity of a row and is unique
# within a file; ``site`` is just ONE representative coordinate out of the ``abn`` pooled,
# and since the three libraries were mutagenised independently the representative differs
# between timepoints for 40% of shared segments.  Match on ``alle``, never on ``site``.
#
# Note also that the Couce DFE has NO lethal tail: across all three timepoints exactly one row
# of 38882 falls below -0.3 (IR2123 at 15K, an intergenic region pooling 2 insertions with
# sterr1 = 0.056 -- noise, not lethality), and it is not present at 2K so it never enters a
# matched pair.  Otherwise the deepest segment is -0.23 / -0.24 / -0.21 at 0K / 2K / 15K.  The
# knockouts that are lethal in DM25 -- amino-acid auxotrophs above all -- are absent from the
# library rather than filtered out of the analysis.  Of the 163 genes Limdi et al. score at
# s < -0.3, only 60 appear in the Couce ancestor library at all, at a median of 1 covered
# segment and 80 reads against 4 segments and 644 reads for the rest; the survivors are the
# C-terminal insertions that leave the protein functional (serB: -0.50 in Limdi, +0.06 here),
# a phenomenon the paper itself documents.  Couce values are consequently commensurate only
# with the Limdi ``s > -0.3`` range, and even there the scales differ (on shared genes of the
# same strain, s_Limdi ~ 1.4 * s_Couce).

# Release strain letter -> (experiment folder, ecotype, media, description, n_replicates).
# Letters are unique across the whole release.  "Ecotype" is the genotype: REL606 is the ancestor,
# S and L are the two diversified Ara-2 ecotypes.  Media and description are split because they
# are independent: DM25 is used by THREE different experiments (E_SLR daily batch, E_PQT
# exponential, E_U the 8-day repeat), so the medium alone does not identify the condition and the
# growth regime alone does not identify the medium.  Both come from the release's BarSeq_meta.csv.
# ALL FIVE monoculture experiments are SERIAL DILUTION -- there is no chemostat and no continuous
# culture anywhere in the release.  What differs between them is the dilution factor and the
# transfer interval, and the physiological consequence of those two numbers is whether the culture
# ever exhausts its carbon inside a cycle.  That is the whole content of "full cycle" vs "exp only"
# below (Ascensao et al. 2023, Nat Commun 14:248, Methods "BarSeq experiments"):
#
#   E_SLR "Mono"     DM25 (25 mg/L glucose), 1:100 every 24 h, 5x50 mL flasks, 4 days.  The
#                    standard LTEE regime: exactly log2(100) = 6.6439 gen/day, glucose gone after
#                    a few hours, the rest of the day spent in stationary phase.
#   E_U   "Mono 2"   the same regime, 3x50 mL flasks, 8 days, four biological replicates.
#   E_MNO "1:10 dil" DM27.8, 1:10 every 24 h, 1 L flask (180 mL media + 20 mL culture), 8 days.
#                    Still a full batch cycle, exactly log2(10) = 3.3219 gen/day.  27.8 mg/L is
#                    chosen so 0.9 x 27.8 = 25 mg/L glucose after the transfer, i.e. the same
#                    glucose as DM25; the authors' stated purpose is to LENGTHEN stationary phase
#                    relative to exponential, since only 3.32 doublings are needed to refill.
#   E_PQT "Glu exp"  DM25 again, and 1:100 again, but transferred every 4.5-5 h (S, L) or 7.5-8 h
#                    (REL606) -- the measured length of DM25 exponential phase.  Same medium and
#                    same dilution factor as E_SLR; the culture is simply harvested at the end of
#                    exponential growth, so stationary phase is deleted.  Generations per transfer
#                    from CFU counts, not assumed.  Only REL606's first two transfers survived
#                    (the third bottlenecked), so T rests on 3 timepoints where P and Q have 5.
#   E_GHI "Ac exp"   DM2000-acetate (2000 mg/L sodium acetate), 10 mL in a 50 mL flask, transferred
#                    every 24 h by a VARIABLE volume: OD is measured and the culture diluted to a
#                    target OD_0 so that 24 h later it is at OD ~ 0.6, still mid-exponential.  80x
#                    the carbon of DM25 means it is never approached.  Generations per cycle =
#                    log2(OD_f/OD_0), which is why they differ by strain and replicate: on acetate
#                    REL606 grows at ~0.08/h against L 0.12/h and S 0.18/h.
#
# So "exp only" does NOT mean continuous culture -- it means serially diluted often enough (E_PQT)
# or into enough carbon (E_GHI) that the cells never leave exponential phase.
